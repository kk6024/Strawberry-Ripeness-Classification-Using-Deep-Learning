The increasing demand for high-quality agricultural products has led to the
need for innovative solutions in the field of agriculture, particularly in the
detection and classification of fruit ripeness. This project focuses on
developing a deep learning-based system for detecting strawberries and
classifying their ripeness levels using advanced image processing techniques.
By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning,
the system aims to achieve accurate identification of strawberries in various
stages of ripeness, thereby aiding farmers and producers in making informed
harvesting decisions.
The proposed system utilizes a comprehensive dataset of strawberry images
captured under different lighting conditions and backgrounds to ensure
robustness and reliability. Preprocessing techniques, including image
normalization and data augmentation, are employed to enhance the model's
performance and generalization capabilities. The CNN architecture is
fine-tuned to distinguish between various ripeness categories—such as unripe,
ripe, and overripe—based on visual features, enabling real-time classification
during the harvesting process. Ultimately, the successful implementation of this deep learning model will
provide an automated solution for strawberry producers, improving the
efficiency of harvesting operations and ensuring the delivery of high-quality
fruits to consumers. By enhancing the accuracy of ripeness classification, this
project not only contributes to increased agricultural productivity but also
supports sustainable farming practices, reducing waste and ensuring optimal
use of resources in the supply chain.
